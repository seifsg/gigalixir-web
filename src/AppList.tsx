    // there is a request in flight so when an app create action is being dispatched
    // isLoading becomes true and the background behind the modal flips over
    // and shows the list view which is weird. our plan is to basically stop
    // using isLoading i.e. state.admin.loading entirely if possible
    // and start using a specific loading variable for each action or ui
    // element. we didn't dig into exactly how to do that here because
    // loadedOnce seems to take care of our use cases, but we will eventually
    // want to do that. Query and Mutation looked promising, but this section here
    // gets it's data from ListController which is harder to hook into. We will
    // probably need to eject ListController to do this and dispatch out own
    // actions to set loading states for each scenario.

    // doesn't clutter things up much. and extracting them is
    // such a hassle right now
    //
    // Obsolete now that we use loadedOnce instead of isLoading, but leaving it
    // here because it's an important lesson to remember.
    // We use display block/none instead of rendering the sections conditionally
    // because we have state that we don't want cleared out. For example, DialogButton
    // holds state about whether the dialog is open. If shouldShowEmptyView toggles
    // for some reason, then the dialog loses it's state and closes. This happens
    // for example, if there is some weird shift in loading state which can happen
    // if we make shouldShowEmptyVIew dependent on isLoading which is a global
    // loading counter that is incremented when the app create save button is clicked.
    // this results in the dialog closing and no errors shown when there is a
    // failure.
